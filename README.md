# My-Schedule-App
This Android app displays a weekly schedule using TableLayout within ConstraintLayout. Users can view and manage daily schedules in morning, afternoon, and evening periods. Each schedule entry is a clickable TextView, allowing users to dynamically update their schedules by opening an edit screen.
