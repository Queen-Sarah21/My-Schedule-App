My Schedule App 

This Android project displays a weekly schedule using a TableLayout within a ConstraintLayout. Users can view and manage their daily schedules, categorized into morning, afternoon, and evening periods. The app provides an interactive way to update schedule entries, with each TextView in the table acting as a clickable item to edit schedules dynamically.

Key features include:

Schedule Model: A Schedule class for representing each schedule entry, with customizable text and color. 

Interactive UI: Users can click on any schedule cell to open a ChangeSchedule activity, where they can modify the entry and return to the main view. 

Intent-based Communication: The app uses ActivityResultLauncher for handling data exchange between activities.
